# Cloud Computing Notes

## Definition

Cloud computing means delivering computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet rather than using local servers or personal computers.

Think: **"Rent IT resources instead of owning them."**

---

## Main Features

1. **On-demand self-service** – Access anytime.
2. **Scalability** – Increase/decrease resources as needed.
3. **Pay-as-you-go** – Pay only for what you use.
4. **Accessibility** – Access from anywhere.
5. **Reliability** – High uptime and backups.

---

## Types of Cloud Computing

1. **Public Cloud** – Services over the internet (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
2. **Private Cloud** – Exclusive for one organization.
3. **Hybrid Cloud** – Combination of public and private.

## Cloud Service Models

1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

   * Provides servers, storage, networking.
   * Example: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.

2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

   * Provides tools/platforms to build apps.
   * Example: Heroku, Google App Engine.

3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

   * Ready-to-use software over the internet.
   * Example: Gmail, Google Drive, Zoom.

## Benefits

* Scalability
* Pay-as-you-go
* Accessibility
* Reliability

---

## Quick Memory Tip

Think: **"S.P.A.R."**

* **S** = Scalability
* **P** = Pay-as-you-go
* **A** = Accessibility
* **R** = Reliability

---

## Real-Life Examples

* Netflix → Uses AWS for streaming.
* Google Drive → Cloud storage.
* Zoom, Gmail → SaaS applications.

---

**Summary:**
Cloud computing = **Renting IT resources from the internet instead of owning them.**
