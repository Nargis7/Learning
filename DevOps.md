# DevOps Notes

## Definition

DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that bridge the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to deliver software faster, more reliably, and continuously by encouraging collaboration.

---

## Why DevOps?

Traditionally:

* Developers write code 🚀
* Operations deploy & manage it ⚙️

Problems: delays, miscommunication, bugs.

Solution: Automate and integrate the software lifecycle — coding → building → testing → deploying → monitoring.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Collaboration** – Developers + Operations work together.
2. **Automation** – Automate repetitive tasks.
3. **Continuous Integration (CI)** – Frequent integration and testing.
4. **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)** – Quick & safe releases.
5. **Monitoring & Feedback** – Track performance and fix issues fast.

---

## DevOps Lifecycle

1. **Plan** – Define requirements.
2. **Code** – Develop software.
3. **Build** – Compile/package.
4. **Test** – Automated testing.
5. **Release** – Prepare deployment.
6. **Deploy** – Push to production.
7. **Operate** – Manage infrastructure.
8. **Monitor** – Track performance & feedback.

## Popular DevOps Tools

* **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
* **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
* **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes
* **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Puppet, Chef
* **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Quick Memory Tip

Think: **"DevOps = Culture + Tools + Processes"**

Mnemonic: **C.A.M.P**

* **C** = Collaboration
* **A** = Automation
* **M** = Monitoring
* **P** = Performance improvement

## Real-Life Example

**Netflix** uses DevOps to deliver new features and updates quickly without downtime.

---

**Summary:**
DevOps is a **culture + toolset** to make software development & operations work together seamlessly for faster delivery and better quality.
