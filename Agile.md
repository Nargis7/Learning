# Agile Notes

## Definition

Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and delivering small, working pieces of software frequently rather than completing everything at once.

Think: **"Work in small steps, improve continuously."**

---

## Key Idea

Instead of a long process where everything is planned upfront (like Waterfall), Agile uses short cycles called **sprints** to develop, test, and deliver parts of a project continuously.

---

## Agile Principles (Simplified)

1. Customer satisfaction through continuous delivery.
2. Welcome changing requirements.
3. Deliver working software frequently.
4. Collaboration between developers and business people daily.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
6. Face-to-face communication.
7. Working software as the main progress measure.
8. Sustainable development pace.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence.
10. Simplicity.
11. Self-organizing teams.
12. Regular reflection for improvement.

| Agile                      | Waterfall                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |

## Real-Life Example

Netflix uses Agile to update its platform quickly by rolling out features incrementally and adjusting based on feedback.

**Summary:**
Agile = **Fast, flexible, collaborative software development.**
